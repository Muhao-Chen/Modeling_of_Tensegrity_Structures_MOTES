# Modeling of Tensegrity Structrues (MOTES)

### **Welcome to **MOTES** software!**

#### General Information
 
Our research team focuses on integrating structure and control design using Tensegrity structure. The group focuses on designing the tensegrity structures to meet the specified objectives. These objectives can vary from minimizing the mass of the structure to controlling the structure to meet certain performance. This software is intended to study the statics and dynamics of tensegrity systems. The authors would like to make this as an open source software to help other researchers who are also interested in this field.

---

#### setup.m 
If one wants to start using the TEAM software, 'setup.m' is to be run only the first time.
Open MATLAB and run 'setup.m' file, it will:

- Add all library functions to MATLAB path, 
- Add the Software Verification and Examples,
- Add User Guide,
- Add Videos folder,
- Add JOSS paper.

#### JossPaper

This folder contains the journal paper corresponding to the software, including source file documents and reference. The journal paper will provide the background introduction, a summary of our work, applications, and references, etc. 

#### Function Library

This folder contains:

All the library functions for tensegrity statics and dynamcis analysis are organized in this folder. By following instructions of statics and dynamics analysis from ''User_Guide.pdf", one can perform the analysis.

#### Software Verification and Examples

This folder contains:

1. Dynamics Examples

Here, we give examples to verify and demonstrate the dynamics of this software.

2. Statics Examples

Here, we give examples to verify and demonstrate the statics of this software.

#### User Guide

This folder contains "User_Guide.pdf". The file provides the detailed description, how to use the software, various applications, and how to become a developer as well.

#### Videos
Some interesting tensegrity animation examples are shown in this folder.
