# Tensegrity_Engineering_Analysis_Master (TEAM)

%% ^_^ Welcome to Tensegrity Engineering Analysis Master(TEAM) software! ^_^ %%

General Information: 
Our research team focuses on integrating structure and control design using Tensegrity structure. The group focuses 
on designing the tensegrity structures to meet the specified objectives. These objectives can vary from minimizing the 
mass of the structure to controlling the structure to meet certain performance. This software is intended to study the 
statics and dynamics of tensegrity systems. The authors would like to make this as an open source software to help other 
researchers who are also interested in this field. 

Tensegrity Engineering Analysis Master(TEAM) folder contains the following parts:

<setup.m> 
If one wants to start using the TEAM software, 'setup.m' is to be run only the first time.
Open MATLAB and run 'setup.m' file, it will:
a) Add all necessary functions to MATLAB path,
b) Open ''User_Guide.pdf" automatically, please follow the step-by-step instructions from the User Guide.

<JOSS_Paper>
This folder contains the journal paper corresponding to the software, including source file documents and a pdf. 
The journal paper will provide the background introduction, a summary of our work, applications, 
and references, etc. 

<Main>
This folder contains two subfolders:
a) Tensegrity_Statics_Main
All the necessary functions for tensegrity statics analysis are organized in this folder.
By following instructions of statics analysis from ''User_Guide.pdf", one can perform the statics analysis.
b) Tensegrity_Dynamics_Main
All the necessary functions for tensegrity dynamics analysis are organized in this folder.
By following instructions of dynamics analysis from ''User_Guide.pdf", one can perform the dynamics analysis.

<Test_Examples>
Here, we give the .m files which are used to test this software. Detailed analysis can be found in Chapter 7 of "User_Guide.pdf."

<Tensegrity_Examples>
Here, we list a few .m file examples from our research projects to show various applications of tensegrity and this software.

<User_Guide>
This folder contains "User_Guide.pdf". The file provides the detailed description, how to use the software, various applications, 
and how to become a developer as well.

<Videos>
Some interesting tensegrity animation examples are shown here.
