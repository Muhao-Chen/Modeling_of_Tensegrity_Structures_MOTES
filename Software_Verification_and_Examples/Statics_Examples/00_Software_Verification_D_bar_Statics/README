We suggest user read the D_bar_Statics.pptx, and it contains the mathematical equations as well as the D-bar statics example.  

Structure configuration is given as D_Bar_Structure_Configuration.png. 

Apply horizontal compressive force at node 1 and 3, and expected results should be like D_Bar_Structure_Mass.png.

Run equilibrium_D_Bar.m to check the example.
